## Additional instructions:

The following folder named `json` needs to be added inside the `public` folder. This folder has 3 files `IMDb names.json`, `IMDb names.json`,
and `IMDb ratings.json`. We were not able to add these files onto github since they exceed the file size allowed on github. The `json` folder can be downloaded from this link:
